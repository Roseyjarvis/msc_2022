Alex:
The OTU_table.csv contains a matrix of raw abundances, rows are sites, columns are species hypothesis from UNITE 7
environmental.csv is a collated dataframe of all environmental variables averaged across measured years for each site
sites_with_biogeography.csv gives you a little more info about the sites, you may or may not need it
